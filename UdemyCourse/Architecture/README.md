# Features And Architecture

## Compilier vs Architecture
A compiler will take your human readable code and translate it down to other languages where its machine readable. An interpreter will only give you the "result" of your program. Meaning it directly translates your code. Languages like c/c++ are compiler languages whereas Javascript is an interpreted language. Java is a mix between these two. <br>

Heres how java works in short: 
<ul>
    <li>
        We have a ```file.java``` code we write and then later compile. When we run our program we turn our java file into byte code: ```file.class```; note this when we use ```javac file``` as a command to build our class file.
    </li>
    <li> 
        However, if we use ```java file```, it then gets interpreted in the Java Virtual Machine(JVM) which is an interpreter of the Java language. This is how Java is a mic of both interpreter and compiler language
    </li>

</ul>
