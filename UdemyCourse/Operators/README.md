# Operators Intro

## Arithmetic Operators
These are your trivial operators in math. 
<ul>
    <li>+</li>
    <li>-</li>
    <li>*</li>
    <li>/</li>
    <li>% - modular operator</li>
</ul>

# Bitwise Operators

<ul>
    <li>AND (&)</li>
    <li>OR (||)</li>
    <li>NOT (!)(~)</li>
    <li>XOR (^)</li>
    <li>Right shift (>>)</li>
    <li>Unsigned left shift (<<)</li>
    <li>Unsigned right shift (>>>)</li>
</ul>

# Left Right shifting
Whenever you shift to the right by 1 its as if you were multiplying by 2.
If you happen to be shifting by 2, then its as if you were multiplying by 2. 
Left shifting is the same idea as doing this: 2^k. 
Now if we use right shift its as if were doing this: n / (2^k)
